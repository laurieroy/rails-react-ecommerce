# O-sale, a Rails e-commerce site with React frontend

[demo](https://laurie-osale.herokuapp.com/)

The concept is a generic online shop, o-sale, selling products. Products have a name, description and price. Logged in users may add, edit and delete products, as well as comment on them. 


The instructor provides some static pages, which are then converted to a Rails site. (commit b451c7a1445af)


Database level requirements were not included. 

User is roll-your-own
